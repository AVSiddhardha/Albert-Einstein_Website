        <h3>About</h3>
        <a
          >Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist whose groundbreaking work transformed our understanding of space, time, and energy. 
          He is most famous for his theory of relativity, particularly the equation E = mc², which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy. 
          Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed early interest in mathematics and physics, eventually completing his education in Switzerland. 
          His major contributions include the Special Theory of Relativity(1905), which revolutionized the concept of space and time, and the General Theory of Relativity (1915), which described gravity as the curvature of spacetime. 
          In 1905, he also explained the photoelectric effect, showing that light behaves as both a wave and a particle, a discovery that earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. 
          Einstein’s work on Brownian motion provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms, further solidifying his impact on modern physics. Despite his attempts to develop a unified field theory to connect gravity and electromagnetism, this remained unfinished. Einstein’s legacy extends beyond science, as he was a passionate advocate for civil rights, peace, and nuclear disarmament. 
          His contributions and humanitarian efforts have made him one of the most influential figures in both science and popular culture.</a

          a key development in quantum theory.</a
        >
        <a
          >General Theory of Relativity (1915): His General Theory of Relativity redefined our understanding of gravity and space-time, 
          later confirmed by observations of light bending during a solar eclipse in 1919.</a
        >
        <a
          >Move to the U.S. (1933): Fleeing Nazi Germany, Einstein settled in the U.S. and became a professor at Princeton, 
          where he remained for the rest of his life.</a
        >
        <a
          >Letter to Roosevelt (1939): He co-signed a letter warning President Roosevelt about Nazi Germany’s potential to develop nuclear weapons, 
          which contributed to the creation of the Manhattan Project.</a

          giving a lecture on his theory of relativity.
          What Happened: This photo was taken during a lecture tour in the U.S., 
          where Einstein explained his theory of general relativity. The blackboard was filled with his calculations about the curvature of space-time, 
          which revolutionized physics.</a

          What Happened: The two famous men met at the premiere in Hollywood, 
          and the photo captures their unlikely friendship. Chaplin humorously remarked, "The people cheer me because they understand me, 
          and they cheer you because no one understands you."</a

          ><b>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies (1905)</b>
          In this pivotal paper, Einstein introduced the Special Theory of Relativity, which reshaped our understanding of space and time. He discussed how the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. The paper's conclusion is encapsulated in the famous equation 
          E = mc² establishing the equivalence of mass and energy.
